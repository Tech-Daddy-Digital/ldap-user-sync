## Implementation Notes

### Dependencies Priority
1. **Critical**: `ldap3`, `PyYAML`
2. **Important**: `cryptography` for SSL
3. **Optional**: `pyjks` for JKS support (can be deferred)

### Development Strategy
- Implement phases 1-3 first for solid foundation
- Phase 4 can be developed with mock vendors initially
- Phase 5 is the core logic - requires careful testing
- Phases 6-8 can be developed in parallel once core is stable
- Phase 9 documentation should be updated throughout development

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each module as it's developed
- Integration tests after Phase 5
- Full end-to-end testing in Phase 7
- Container testing in Phase 8

### Risk Mitigation
- LDAP connection handling is critical - implement robust retry logic
- Vendor API failures should not crash entire sync
- Configuration validation prevents runtime failures
- Comprehensive logging aids troubleshooting
- Email notifications ensure operational awareness
